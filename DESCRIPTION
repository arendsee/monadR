Title: A Monadic Pipeline System
Description:
    A monadic solution to pipeline analysis. All operations -- and the errors,
    warnings and messages they emit -- are merged into a directed graph. Infix
    binary operators mediate when values are stored, how exceptions are
    handled, and where pipelines branch and merge. The resulting structure may
    be queried for debugging or report generation. 'rmonad' complements, rather
    than competes with, non-monadic pipeline packages like 'magrittr' or
    'pipeR'.
